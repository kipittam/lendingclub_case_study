# Project Title: Lending Club Case Study
> Project Description: 
 This project is all about diving into loan default data to uncover patterns and factors that might indicate whether a borrower is likely to default on their loan. By using exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques, we aim to extract valuable insights that can help a consumer finance company make smarter lending decisions and reduce credit losses. The dataset includes details about past loan applicants and their repayment statuses, allowing us to differentiate between those who defaulted and those who didn't.

## Objectives
- Get to the bottom of what causes loan defaults.
- Identify high-risk loan applicants to cut down on potential credit losses.
- Generate valuable insights to aid in making informed loan approval decisions


## Data Source
  - The dataset spans from 2007 to 2011 and includes detailed loan information. It covers various applicant and loan attributes that can influence the likelihood of default.

## Methodology
  - Data Loading and Cleaning: Start by loading the dataset, addressing any missing values, and preprocessing the categorical variables to ensure the data is ready for analysis.
  - Univariate Analysis: Dive into individual attributes to get a sense of their distribution and overall characteristics.
  - Bivariate Analysis: Investigate the relationships between applicant attributes and loan default rates. Use visualizations to highlight any significant correlations.
  - Visualization: Create various plots to clearly present the key findings from the analysis.
  - Conclusion and Recommendations: Wrap up by summarizing the insights gained and providing actionable recommendations to enhance the loan approval process.

## Summary
  - Around 14.5% of borrowers have defaulted on their loans.
  - Most borrowers take out loans for debt consolidation, followed by credit card repayment with debt consolidation being the most common reason.
  - The common loan amount lended is with highest frequency  between $5,000-$10,000 range, and also it is most common defaulting amount range.

  - Small Business and Renewable energy are showing higher default rates. 
  - Borrowers with home ownership as  mortgage or RENT are more likely to fully repay their loans.
  - High range loan amounts are associated with a higher risk  of charge-offs. That too, high range amounts with low installement at long loan term are having highest defaulting cases.

## Conclusion
   - Loan status is influenced by a mix of factors, including annual income, loan purpose, and homeownership.
   - Borrowers with higher incomes are more likely to repay their loans on time, highlighting the significant role of income.
   - The purpose of the loan also matters, as loans for Small Business are associated with higher risk.
   - Additionally, borrowers with larger loan amounts are more likely to be charged off.
   - Homeownership, particularly with a mortgage, is generally a positive indicator and is associated with better loan performance.
